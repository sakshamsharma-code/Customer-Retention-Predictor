## 🧠 Model Details
The model was trained on a customer churn dataset using features such as:
```
Tenure
MonthlyCharges
TotalCharges
Contract Type
Internet Service
Payment Method
```
And more...

The trained classifier outputs both a Yes/No churn prediction and a probability score.

## 🤖 How Retention Suggestions Work
If the model predicts churn, a request is sent to Gemini Pro using a prompt built from customer details. Gemini responds with 2–3 realistic, personalized strategies for retaining the customer.
